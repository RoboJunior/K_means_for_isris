# Finding Optimal Clusters in Iris Dataset using K-Means and Elbow Method

# Summary
In this GitHub project, I explore the popular Iris dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify the optimal number of clusters. The goal is to gain insights into the underlying patterns and structure of the data by finding the appropriate number of clusters that best represent the dataset.

# Approach

**Data Exploration:** I begin by loading and exploring the Iris dataset, which contains information about three different species of iris flowers, along with their petal and sepal measurements.

**K-Means Clustering:** I implement the K-Means clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised learning technique, to partition the data into clusters based on similarity. By varying the number of clusters, I create several K-Means models.

**Elbow Method:** To determine the optimal number of clusters, I employ the Elbow Method. This technique involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The "elbow point" in the plot indicates the optimal number of clusters, where adding more clusters does not significantly reduce WCSS.

**Visualization:** I visualize the K-Means clustering results and the Elbow Method plot to gain insights into the clustering performance and identify the ideal number of clusters for the Iris dataset.

# Results
Through the implementation of K-Means and the Elbow Method, I successfully identify the optimal number of clusters that best represents the underlying patterns in the Iris dataset. The visualization of clusters and the Elbow Method plot provide a clear understanding of the dataset's structure.

# Conclusion
The GitHub repository contains the code, dataset, and visualization results, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring clustering techniques and understanding the Iris dataset. Additionally, this project serves as a stepping stone for applying K-Means and the Elbow Method to other datasets for insightful clustering analysis. Users can further enhance the project by experimenting with different clustering algorithms or exploring other methods for determining the optimal number of clusters.
